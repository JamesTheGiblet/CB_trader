# 🧠 CB_Trader — Terminal Oracle of Crypto Signals

> _“The market speaks. CB_Trader listens.”_

Welcome, traveler. You've uncovered **CB_Trader**, a cryptographic observatory woven from code, resilience, and signal lore. It’s a terminal-bound companion forged to track price motions, detect whispers of momentum, and log every tremor with care. No GUI. No frills. Just truth beneath candlesticks.

## 🌑 What CB_Trader Is

- A **signal-seeking shrine** built in Python.
- A pure **terminal companion**—no clutter, just clarity.
- Focused on **robust data logging**, **resilient APIs**, and **beautiful debugging**.
- Tracks 5 cryptos by default: the canonical five—Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, BNB.
- Emits buy/sell whispers based on technical ritual: SMA, RSI, and soon, MACD & EMA.

### 🔧 Core Philosophy

CB_Trader believes in:

- **Persistence over flash**—SQLite stores every tick, every omen.
- **Modularity as dogma**—every component is a self-contained prayer.
- **Logs as scripture**—errors, events, and signals archived like sacred texts.

### ⚙️ Project Rituals

Each file plays a part in the signal symphony:

| File                | Role in the Rites                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`           | The High Priest — orchestrates signal summons and terminal display |
| `coinbase_api.py`   | The Messenger — fetches price and candlestick data from on high    |
| `database.py`       | The Archivist — stores whispers into SQLite stone                  |
| `analysis.py`       | The Sage — processes indicators and conjures buy/sell signals      |
| `config.py`         | The Codex — holds your divine preferences                          |
| `utils.py`          | The Lantern — logging, formatting, guiding the path                |

### 🌀 Signal Lore (MVP)

Here’s what happens when the bot awakens:

1. It whispers: “Fetching data…”
2. It gazes into candlesticks.
3. It invokes the sacred indicators (SMA, RSI).
4. It logs every heartbeat, signal, error, and success.
5. It speaks in the terminal when the time is right:  
   👉 _Buy... The winds favor BTC._  
   👉 _Sell... XRP's momentum wanes._

### 📈 What Lies Ahead

Ritual expansion awaits:

- More indicators (MACD, Bollinger, EMA)
- Backtesting as dream-walking through past data
- Performance logging like heartbeat scrolls
- Mythic verbosity toggle to narrate signals with poetic gravitas
